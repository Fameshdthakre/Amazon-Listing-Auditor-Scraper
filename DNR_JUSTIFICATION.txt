The "Listing Auditor for Amazon" extension uses the `declarativeNetRequest` API to improve scraping performance, reduce bandwidth usage, and enhance user privacy during automated auditing tasks.

Specific usage scenarios:

1.  **Bandwidth & Performance Optimization:**
    When auditing hundreds of product URLs in "Scraper Mode" or "Audit Mode", loading high-resolution images, video ads, and tracking scripts for every page drastically slows down the process and consumes excessive user bandwidth. We use `declarativeNetRequest` to block these resource types (`image`, `script`, `sub_frame`) initiated by Amazon domains (Rule 100). This allows the text-based data extraction to complete significantly faster.

2.  **Privacy & Safety:**
    The extension blocks requests to known advertising and tracking domains (e.g., `doubleclick.net`, `criteo.com`, `amazon-adsystem.com`) to prevent user tracking during the automated browsing session.

3.  **User Control:**
    This blocking behavior is not always-on. It is conditionally enabled based on the user's preference ("Disable Images" checkbox in the UI). The extension dynamically updates the enabled rulesets to respect this choice.

This usage is strictly functional and essential for the tool's "Audit" capability, ensuring it can process large batches of URLs efficiently without crashing the browser or exhausting network resources.
